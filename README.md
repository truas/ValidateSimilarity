Program designed to validate WordSimilarity Benchmark, not command line friendly (uncomment lines on main_control_xy.py to alter this). Git repository just just used as backup.

- main_control_ws.py: WordSimilarity for benchmark without context
- main_control_cs.py: WordSimilarity for benchmark with context
- main_control_wncs.py: WordSimilarity for benchmark with context and using newBSD algorithm to transform the context of each sentence into a sequence of synsets
